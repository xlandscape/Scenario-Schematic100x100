## About the project
A schematic scenario consisting of a field and an adjacent off-field habitat.
This is an automatically generated documentation based on the available scenario metadata. The current version of this 
document is from 2021-09-08.

### Built with
The scenario can be used in the following Landscape Models:
* xOffFieldSoilRisk version 1.1.0 and higher


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you use the latest version of the Landscape Model.

### Installation
Copy the complete scenario folder unaltered into the `scenario` sub-directory of your model. Reference the scenario
from the model parameterization. For details how to reference the scenario from the user parameterization, see the 
`README` of the model.


## Usage
The scenario adds the following macros to the Landscape Model:
* `:weather_mars-97100` (version 1.3.5)
* `:LandscapeScenario` (version 1.0)
* `:VfsMod_lookup_table` (version 1)

### Roadmap
The scenario is final and not further developed. It will be, however, updated to reflect new requirements by the 
Landscape Model core and individual Landscape Model variants.
